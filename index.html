 <h2>Lesson 1, HTML and the Web</h2>
 <div class="brownpaper">
  <p>
  <em><strong>HTML</strong></em> is the language of the web,it stands  for Hyper Text Markup language. The majority of the web pages that we view are based in HTML. In order to access these HTML documents we must what we call the <em><strong>Web</strong></em>,
  which is a massive agregate of computeres that communicate with one another. Because the web has such a wealth of data we employ the use of a search engine/browser such as Google Chrome to assist us in finding the files that are relevant to what we
  are looking for.</p>

 <h3>
 <em><strong>HTML</strong>    </em> continued</h3>
 <div class="brownpaper">
 <p>The <span class="bold">HTML</span> documents of the web are made up primarily with two items, which are: <b>Elements</b>, and <b>Tags</b>. Elements hold all of the content and how they are displayed is determined using tags. For example I have made the
  word <b>Bold</b> bold with a bold tag. There are two types of elements which are:
  <span class="bold">Block</span> and <span class="bold">Inline</span>. Inline elements usually happen on the same line of text as they are written, and block elements form invisible boxes arount the content they enclose.
  </div>
  <h2>Lesson 2, The structure of HTML</h2>
  <div class="paper">
   <p>HTML as I stated earlier is made up of elements and tags. By using developer tools via google chrome you can inspect a page and the elements within it. When looking at a page with developer tools you can see the entire structure of a page and all of its elements.  
     <br>
     <br>
   When you break down the structure of an HTML page you can see that it is made up of many boxes. Some of these boxes are even nested within other boxes creating a tree like structure.
      </p>
  </div>
  <h2> Lesson 3, Eliminate Repetition </h2>
  <div class="paper">
    <p>Avoiding repetition one of the keys to becoming a successful programmer. It saves time and energy by preventing a coder from copying and pasting or just rewriting code over and over again. Not only does this sam=ve time, it also helps to reduce the number of errors that can be made over time. The more concise the code the better.
    <br>
    <br>
     Using somthing like <b>CSS</b> also allows for consistency. This will allow a web page to look much more uniform in design and presentation.</p>
